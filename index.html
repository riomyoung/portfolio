                        My name is Rio Young and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Virginia Tech! While at Tech, I joined and worked on an Undergraduate Research group called <a href="https://csgenome.org/">The CSGenome Project</a>, which is making the first scientific effort to catalog the lineage of computer system performance over time. I have learned how how to create API endpoints and about  professional software testing, as well as front end development and best practices in website development. In my  internships, I learned how to use new tools such as Google Cloud Console and how to effectively teach others in a simple and straight to the point manner.

                    <p>
                      In my spare time, I enjoy playing and designing video games and making art. I joined the <a href="https://gaming-project-at-vt.itch.io/">Gaming Project at Virginia Tech </a> in Fall 2021 and had a lot of fun learning about game theory and participating in game jams (essentially a hackathon for making a game). I became the Vice President in Fall 2022 and help those in the club learn and have fun doing so! I also started the <a href="https://gobblerconnect.vt.edu/organization/artclubatvt">Art Club at Virginia Tech</a> in Spring 2021, where give students who don't have the means or time to take a college art class the college art class experience! Last semester, I wrote contracts for hiring studio models and organized life drawing classes for students to learn human anatomy!

                In 2021, I created API endpoints for foreign key tables and the tests for those endpoints for the CSGenome Project. This year, I am working on the front end for user submissions in the new crowdsourcing project, which will allow verified online users to submit new computer architecture, microprocessor, memory and system information to our database. At the end of each semester, I write a report and present on my work.

                  In the summer of 2022, I automated the web scraper scripts using Google Cloud. I initially automated them with Google Functions and Schedulers, but realized this would require all of the scripts to be changed to run remotely. I pivoted to an approach using the Google Virtual Machine Instances which would allow the scripts to continue to run locally on a remote machine. Because the other staff working on the scripts had more experience with local scripts, this would save more  man hours than using Google Functions. After this work, I taught the others on my team how they could set up a Google VM as well if they needed to, as well as how to use everything I had set up.

                <br>
                <p>I also created scripts used for testing remote programs that would send a report in an email to those in the Research department and managed any other miscellaneous tech related tasks or issues, such as researching API vs bulk data options and writing a report on the benefits of each.

I had a lot of fun teaching these young students and seeing their 'Aha!' moments! I also chaperoned them to and from their buses in the morning and at the end of the day, as well as in outdoor activities, such as lunch or recess.

                        <h3>Language Learning App</h3>
                        <p>
                          Learning a new language is far from simple, especially when it comes to learning how to converse. Many apps nowadays focus primarily on writing and reading and finding a native speaker to sit down with you to practice is difficult. This is why in my application, the primary focus is for the user to practice their speaking and listening skills. I have done extensive research on the quickest ways for a person to learn a language. For example, according to the study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12455678/">Success and failure in teaching the [r]-[l] contrast to Japanese adults</a>, instant, repetitive feedback leads to the most robust improvements in learning, especially when it comes to pronunciation. Knowing this, I designed each interaction such that each time a user speaks, their pronunciation will be corrected so they won't accidentally memorize the wrong pronunciation and can quickly improve! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And in 
                          <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-second-language-acquisition/article/abs/students-learn-language-via-a-civilization-coursea-comparison-of-second-language-classroom-environments/E8CF0A9A65581C206D99AB48EA3EA182">Students Learn Language via a Civilization Course—A Comparison of Second Language Classroom Environments</a>, researchers learned that students enrolled in a class for in contemporary
                          French civilization and culture that was taught in French (where the form of the language never discussed) had far higher scores in the M LA-Cooperative French Tests than students who had taken a class focused on the French language itself. With this in mind, the app is essentially a game which happens to be in another language. In it, you can earn money, learn the story of the town you moved into and complete favors for townspeople in exchange for items or to improve your relationship with those people! However, some characters might try to mislead or scam you, putting your language speaking skills to the test!

                        <p>
                          Arbitrage betting is done by placing multiple wagers on different outcomes of a single sports event, allowing the better to make a profit regardless of the outcome. This sports betting bot, developed by my brother, a friend and I, takes advantage of this concept in order to place the best bets on sports teams. The bot develops a formula to optimize hedge, uses formula to determine optimal hedge and uses <a href="https://the-odds-api.com/">TheOdds API</a> to find arbitrage. Currently, using the odds given by the Odds API is our naive approach, so we are considering  developing an algorithm for elo and incorporating it into the betting algorithm or tracking individual players/teams or trends in the plays that could indicate future gameplay.
